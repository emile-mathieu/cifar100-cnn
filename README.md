# CIFAR-100 CNN with PyTorch - Project

This repository demonstrates a PyTorch-based CNN model training on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Features

- Uses batch normalization and dropout for improved training stability.
- Random data augmentation (horizontal flip).
- Shows training and testing accuracy over epochs.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Emile-Mathieu-CIFAR-CNN.ipynb
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the model in the notebook cells.

## Results

- Prints epoch-wise training & test loss and accuracy.
- Generates loss and accuracy plots for easier visualization.
